# Capturing Session Learnings

After completing work, capture useful patterns and insights for future reference.

## What to Document

- Successful patterns and workflows that worked well
- New guidance or requirements from the user
- Common pitfalls discovered and how to avoid them
- Technical insights worth preserving

## Where to Update

- **`.claude/CLAUDE.md`** - Project-wide principles and workflows
- **`.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`** - Skill-specific improvements
- **`docs/`** - Architecture and design decisions
- **Project README** - When adding new capabilities

## Guidelines

- Keep updates concise and scannable
- Merge with existing content rather than duplicating
- Focus on actionable insights
- Use consistent terminology
- Commit changes with a descriptive message explaining what was learned
