# Run linter
npm run lint

# Auto-fix issues

## TypeScript Configuration

All packages are written in TypeScript and include type definitions. Make sure your `tsconfig.json` has:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "target": "ES2022",
    "strict": true
  }
}
```

## Inter-package Dependencies

Some packages depend on others:
- `workflow-engine` depends on `state-tracker`
- `chat` depends on `document-generator` and `throttle`
- `logger` depends on `text`

npm will automatically install peer dependencies when you install a package.
